        <p>General Relativity is the theory by Albert Einstein that is our best
            explanation for gravity so far. It describes how gravity is not a 
            force, but merely a side effect of objects moving through curved space.
            It describes space and time as fundamentally linked, even to the extent 
            of expressing them as parameters of the same 4 dimensional c√∂ordinate 
            system. Einstein showed through his paper that General Relativity works
            because objects with mass bend space around them, and that larger objects 
            bend space more. It uses a type of object called geodesics, which is just
            a curve representing the shortest object between two objects. Einstein shows
            that in space, these curves are not always a straight line due to General 
            Relativity.
