          <li>Recieved a Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1920, </li>
          <li>a Nobel prize in physics in 1921, </li>
          <li>a Matteucci Medal in 1921, </li>
          <li>a Copley Medal in 1925, </li>
          <li>a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1926, </li>
          <li>a Max Planck Medal in 1929, </li>
          <li>and a Franklin medal in 1935.</li>
          <li>Einstein made his four Annus Miriabilis ("Miracle Year") papers while working for the patent office</li>
          <li>Einstein continued working at the patent office until he found an academic post at the University of Zürich in 1909</li>
          <li>In 1913, Einstein was made the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm institute for Physics at the University of Berlin </li>
          <li>In 1915, Einstein published the general theory of relativity, which is considered to be his master work. </li>
          <li>In 1919, there were two expeditions sent to perform an experiment during a solar eclipse to prove Einstein’s theory of relativity. This experiment found that light rays from distant stars were deflected or bent by the gravity of the sun, which proved Einstein’s theory of relativity correct.</li>
          <li>Theory of relativity was the first major theory of gravity since Newton’s theory of gravity over 250 year prior.</li>
          <li>Theory of relativity had a significant impact on the world, with many people regarding it as a Revolution in science. </li>
          <li>After Einstein’s success in regards to the general theory of relativity, Einstein began building on new theories in order to form a new science of cosmology, which held that the universe was dynamic, capable of expanding and contracting.</li>
          <li>Einstein’s papers that he wrote in his miracle year are referred to as his “Annus Mirabilis papers. </li>
          <li>Einstein suggested an alternative Big-Bang theory.</li>
          <li>In 1935 Einstein had an affair with a woman named Margarita Konenkova, who was an alleged <b>Russian Spy</b></li>
