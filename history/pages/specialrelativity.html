<body>
    Special relativity is Einstein's theory about how an object's speed 
    effects its time, space and mass. It it especially useful for objects
    that travel very fast, for example near the speed of light. It shows 
    that the speed of light is a constant, meaning that no matter fast you 
    are moving, you will always observe light travelling at the same speed.
